    "## Generate Training Data for Contextual Games\n",
    "This notebook shows how the training data was generated in the [Nash Fixed Point Networks](arxiv.com) paper. It assumes that the network folders in the original [Transportation Networks Research Project](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks) are present in the local directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook first uses a script obtained from the Transportation Networks website to load the following real data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Incidence matrix for chosen network dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Capacity vector\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Free Flow Time\n",
    "2.   Origin-Destination (OD) Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these are loaded, this notebook then generates contextual data sampled randomly and uses Algorithm 3 in our [paper](arxiv.com) to generate their corresponding actions on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is saved in the local directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "###**Note:** \n",
    "while we show how we generate the data in this notebook, we also provide the exact training data that was used in the paper. You can download the (already generated) data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XsyxT664yjyIXsnAG9gFeKYEtMlWWp-j?usp=sharing)\n",
